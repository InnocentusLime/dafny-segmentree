# What Is This?

A simple implementation of a segment tree in Dafny. The most common array-based one.

# Why?

I have a friend who tried doing this before, but as a task for a course. Their clame were that it is extremely difficult to verify a normal array-based segment tree in Dafny (they ended up verifying a functional-style one).

This problem has already been solved by someone else, but I decided to try and do it blindly for fun(tm).

# Quick Info

The used Dafny version is 3.4.4. You can install it by installing the matching version of the VsCode extension.
